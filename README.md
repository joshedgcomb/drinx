Drinx is an iOS app created for the Spring 2014 5C Hackathon by myself (Josh Edgcomb), Kevin Byrne, John Verticchio, and Billy Mills. We were awarded the prize for Best Design, for which credit goes in large part to Kevin Byrne. As we were under an extreme time crunch (12 hours from start to finish!), the code is messy, but much was learned and many good times were had by all.
